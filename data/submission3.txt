It looks like a Warrior Cats book cover.
I came here for this
 Cutie pie!<3
Something precious this way comes.
Reminds me of The Secret Of Kells
BRUH OTHER PEOPLE READ THAT? XD On a real note,  I loved them as a kid so I bought my wife the whole first series as I knew she would enjoy them. She'll be ready for the 2nd series very soon.
That’s awesome! I grew up with them, so I read the main series as school library books. I own most of the Dawn of the Clans series, but I’ve only read two of them. I really loved Omen of the Stars.
YES
Exactly my thought. Loved that shit in middle school.
Clever girl...
You peice of fuck you beat me to it
Immediately what I thought of!!<3
Ugh I wasted all damn day scrolling on this app and still somehow missed the opportunity to make this joke

Reminds me of The Secret Of Kells
I dont know why, but I immediately thought of Redwall!
I had the same reaction. It’s very similar to the cover of [_Outcast of Redwall_](https://redwall.fandom.com/wiki/Outcast_of_Redwall).
Thank you, I was wracking my brain trying to remember which one had the 6 fingered boii!
This was instantly what I thought of as well!! Actually the only reason I came to the comments was to see if anyone else did. Funnily enough, I’m rereading the whole series right now, and Outcast of Redwall is the next one on the list.
"Every day I worry all day, about what's waiting in the bushes of love"

Immediately what I thought of.
Similar to the blanket shark the elusive shrub shark in the wild.
Bee-boop! Cutie pie!
Something precious this way comes.
Reminds me of the Lord of the Flies cover.  Reading it as an adult, you understand it and appreciate it a lot more.
Phenomenal photo. Gorgeous.
[Photoshopped](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/jyqn35/i_can_see_you/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), but it is excellent, used it as my phone background for a long time.
