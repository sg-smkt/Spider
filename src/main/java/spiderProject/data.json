A lot of people don't realize this, but cats are very emotionally needy and dependent upon us for affection. To you, it might look like your cat is keeping an eye on his human vending machine and judging you from afar, but what he's trying to say is that your presence brings him enough comfort/joy to warrant staying in the same room as you. He's trying to give you space but is also enjoying watching his favorite person! If he turns his back to you, that means he trusts you enough to be in a vulnerable position. As for the face, that's just cats for you :)\n\nAs for that thing cats do where it seems like they lure you in with a request for belly rubs, only to bite and scratch, this isn't actually the case. When a cat shows you their belly, it's the same principle as when they turn their back to you - a display of trust - but more. So it's surprising to them when we violate this trust on some level and invade their personal space, and their natural response to something in such a vulnerable spot is to bite and claw.\n\nCats also don't enjoy being firmly petted like dogs do; petting cats the length of their bodies with your palm can build up very unpleasant tension in their bodies and make them feel like they need to lash out as a release.\n\n\\---------\n\n\\*I really can't remember where I read this - it's either from one of the books on animals I've read this year or from a random internet post, but I did a quick google and am almost certain that what I'm saying here should hold up. I could have left some things out or gotten details wrong, so if it matters to you, make sure you stay cynical and fact-check everything here <3", "Almost everything you said is right, but needs an asterisk by it with the note of \"varies by cat because they all have unique personalities.\"\n\nSome cats love belly rubs.

He will get the birds to pose with kids for photo ops and does some tricks, it's a whole show he puts on.  Well one day I'm having a beer at the bar, and he comes in to take a break.  So he and I are in the back of a no name bar (don't ask me the name of the no name bar) sitting together at one of the tables having some light conversation.  It's very mellow, 2:00 in the afternoon, just a few regulars hanging out   He's got one of cockatoos with him, perched on his arm.  After a few minutes the cockatoo gets off of him and walks across the table and perches on my arm.  Cool!  (I know nothing about birds by the way).  So we are just sitting there sipping our drinks.  I'm moving real slow, I don't want to disturb the bird, and it's a pretty cool moment for me.  The bird, out of nowhere , means over and takes a chunk out of my ear.  Ive got a crease in my ear now.

My name is griffi and welcome to my channel!  I am a goffins cockatoo and I just love to dance.   My mommy and daddy are fosters for the Florida Parrot Rescue and loved me so much they couldn't let me go so I became a permanent part of the family!  I have 3 doggie siblings and another bird sibling (but she's bossy and doesn't like it when I get attention) but I don't care as long as I get to dance! I had a pretty rough life before the rescue got me which is why I look the way I do but I still stay happy!  Looks aren't everything and I know I dance better than most so I don't care! I hope you enjoy my channel and be sure to check back often for more of my slick moves!

Animals like birds that have brains tuned into noise are able to understand some of it, but they have a limited comprehension of beat (how you can tap along to a song). They understand pitch, but they don\u2019t hear octaves as being the same note just higher or lower from what we know.\n\nSo it seems like a lot of it has to do with speech and pattern recognition.

So yes, similar to humans in some ways, though they're unlikely to get the whole emotions and stories bit.", "There was a study with monkeys and a few other animals where they would play classical music in one room, and rock music in the other, and all the animals would choose the room with classical music.\n\nBut when given a room with classical music or silence, the animals chose the silent room.", "Used to keep budgies for years.
